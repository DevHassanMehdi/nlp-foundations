## Methods

- Tokenization:
- Language models (unigram/bigram):
- Smoothing (add-k):
- Evaluation (cross-entropy, perplexity):

## Results

| Model | add_k | cross_entropy | perplexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unigram | 0.0 | TBD | TBD |
| Bigram | 0.0 | TBD | TBD |
| Bigram | 0.1 | TBD | TBD |

## Discussion

Discuss what the results suggest about model performance and smoothing.

## Time Spent
